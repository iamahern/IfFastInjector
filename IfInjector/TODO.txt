- RESEARCH:
	- Need for IDisposable???

- MISSING FEATURES:
	- Since removed mutability lost way to dynamically load modules.
		- Clean solution (without breaking mutability rules) is to allow for parent / child injectors
		- Child injectors can handle explicit bindings / while 'implicit' bindings would be handled by the parent
	
- TESTING:
	- Add platform tests for Android, iPhone

- WISH LIST:
	- Generics
	- Extension feature to allow for interceptors
	- Take a look at covariance handlers:
		- http://simpleinjector.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Advanced-scenarios&referringTitle=Documentation
		- Better to give user control than force feature
	- Seperate 'scanning' function to allow for user defined attributes
