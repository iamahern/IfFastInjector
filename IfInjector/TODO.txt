
- RESEARCH:
	- Need for IDisposable???

- DEFECT:
	- Property injection broken for factories

	- EDGE Cases:
		- How should singleton or (when we have them) custom lifecycles be handled?
		- If modification of a dependent type occurs, should we clear the resolver or throw an exception...
			- This probably requires a config setting for the behavior
		- If an assembly creates new types, how should this be handled for implicit types???
			- Think have correct behavior: TODO: test case
		
- MISSING FEATURES:
	- InjectStatic()
	- Need a provider type
	
- TESTING:
	- Add platform tests for Android, iPhone
	- Clean up unit tests
	- White box testing of resolver loop checking??
	- Ensure clear of implicit resolver if set explicit

	- Need to ensure tests also run on factories

- WISH LIST:
	- Generics
	- Custom LifeCycles
	- Extension feature to allow for interceptors
